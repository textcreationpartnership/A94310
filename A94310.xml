            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Two great and bloody Fights between the Engliſh and the French: the firſt, by Gen. Blake, and the French Cheva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers, near the Iſles of Majorca, which continued for the ſpace of 24 houres: the ſecond, at the Iſle of St. Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, by Gen. Pen, and Mounſieur de Poince; with the ſubduing of all the French in De la Martinicque, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He French having for ſome yeares laſt paſt made an incurſion into the Iſles of St. Chriſtophers, and de la Martinic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que, at which time they became Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters thereof, and ſubdued the Engliſh, keeping them as Vaſſals and ſlaves, and expoſing them to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:118796:3"/>moſt inhumane cruelties and tortures; ſo that many honeſt men were deprived of all Earthly Comforts and Enjoyments, till it pleaſed God to uſe a means for their deliverance; by whoſe Series of Providence, great things have been ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted and done for the Engliſh Nation at home, and now more eſpecially for his people abroad; as appeares by theſe enſuing Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations, viz.</p>
            <p>General Pen, and General Venables having ſteered their Coaſt for the Weſtern Iſlands, at laſt bare up towards St. Chriſtophers, and wheel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off to the South-weſt Point, tacked about for the Iſle De la Martinicque, where Major Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Haines 'tis ſaid landed with ſo conſiderable a party, that in ſeven hours time he became wholly Maſter of all that was held by the French, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed their Plantations, and ſeized their Goods, ſecured the priſoners, which are ſaid to be 735, and placed his Gariſons: Since which time, we hear, that they have ſummoned Monſieur de Poince (Governour for the King of France in St. Chriſtophers Iſland) who is reſolved, if they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſail him, to ſell their lives at a dear rate, and that no conditions ſhal be acceptable, though never
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:118796:3"/>ſo equal, for that he wil rather chuſe to die, then falſifie his Loyalty.</p>
            <p>The Engliſh Generals are now upon that coaſt and intend (by Gods permiſſion) ſuddenly to make an Attempt: VVhich the Governour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, hath cauſed to be raiſed great Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works and Fortifications, and thereupon planted many gallant pieces of Ordnance; ſo that the work to ſome may ſeem to be difficult, but feaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enough to ſuch heroical Spirits, who are braſs within, and ſteel without; the Engliſh being thus characterized by the French priſoners.</p>
            <p>And thus it appears they are; for from St. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los they write, That divers of the French Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant men returning from Provence, lad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n with Commodities, and convoyed by five men of war, hapned to meet with an Engliſh frigat, who after 8 hours fight, ſunk 3 of them; but being ſo lamen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tably rent and torn, and exceedingly over-powr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhe at laſt gave them another broad ſide, and by ſinking of one down by her ſide, ſhe charged through and ſo eſcaped; in which Diſpute, the enemy were ſo extreamly battered and ſhattered, that not one of them durſt attempt a purſuit, this frigat had not ſailed many Leagues, but ſhe met
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:118796:4"/>with an Oſtender, who perceiving her to be very much impaired, bare up cloſe to her, preſenting her with three broad ſides, one after another: the Engliſh frigat an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered them again, and plyed them ſo cloſe with great and ſmal ſhot, that after four or five hours fight, the enemy decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Engagement, and ran aground, where the men all periſhed, excepting four, who narrowly eſcaping ſhipwrack, at laſt got to St. Malows.</p>
            <p>To theſe great Atchievments, may be added the renowned Victory of General Blake, which according to the moſt true inteligence is thus repreſented, viz. That the ſaid General having ſent forth a ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron of ſhips towards the Iſlands of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jorca and Minorca, after ſome Leagues paſt, they eſpyed ſome ſhips under ſayl, who making towards them, the other tac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:118796:4"/>about, opened their Ports, put forth their Guns, manned their Decks, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to fight them: ſo that bearing up to each other, the Chevalier de Valie Commander of the French Van, diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged two broad ſides, and was anſwered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: He bare up the ſecond time, but came off with abundance of loſſe; for he was ſo gored by the Unicorn, that his ſhip ſprung a Leak, having at leaſt five foot Water in the Hold; beſides his main Maſt, Boltſprit and Miſne, vvere cut off, by Iron bars, and Chain ſhot, ſo that he cauſed his ſhip to run aground, by vvhich meanes, he ſaved himſelf, his treaſure, and ſeven more in a Long boat, the reſt peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and about 150 vvere ſlain and taken priſoners.</p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:118796:5"/>
            <p>During which time of Action, the Chevalier de la Landes, who commantled the reſt of the French ſhips, were not in the leaſt declining, but after 24 hours bloody Conflict, was boarded and taken, and not a ſhip that belonged to him eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped. Theſe two Commanders were accounted the chief Hectors in thoſe parts, and ſcornd but to bid defiance to the proudeſt Foe that ever ſayled upon the ſea, having vanquiſhed in their time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 150 ſayl of men of war; and yet at the laſt ſubdued with nine Engliſh Frigats, and the loſs of 37 men; as the beſt Intelligence, of theſe Times affirmeth.</p>
